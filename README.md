# themes
Theme files for my Arch Linux setup, centered mainly around the Adapta-Nokto theme

## Suggested themes that are not included in this repo

- ***VS Code*** : The `Adapted` Extension gives proper Adapta-Nokto styling

- ***Jetbrains IDEs*** : Install the `Material Theme UI` plugin, then select the `Oceanic` theme

- ***Icons*** : Adapta suggests you go with the [Papirus](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme), but I personally use [Sweet Folders](https://github.com/EliverLara/Sweet-folders) with [Candy Icons](https://github.com/EliverLara/candy-icons) cuz I like the neon aesthetics (but the [Sweet theme](https://github.com/EliverLara/Sweet) was a little too much for me)

- ***Cursors*** : [Material Cursors](https://github.com/varlesh/material-cursors), default version.
